# Sky: Children of the Light midi player
A software that converts MIDI files and input devices into controls for musical instruments from "Sky: Children of the Light"

# Usage
Run `skyPlayer.py` using Python >= 3.10 with the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` installed.

Use `skyPlayer.py filename` to play a MIDI file, or run it with no arguments to connect to a MIDI input device.

Note that this software currently only works properly using the US international keyboard layout. Feel free to ask for more layouts or add them yourself through a pull request!
